# E-MailAutomationFramework

This is a framework which lets you automate your mails if you are sending a planned mail. You can keep them in a repository with date that should be sent on.

In my framework you can have a database with tables like Header,Body,Footer and reciepent list. This info can be placed in Excel as well. We can have switch where we can decide which approach we would like to use. We can add other sources with template and corresponding action.

I make this open to modify. Please Add your input to it and make it great.
